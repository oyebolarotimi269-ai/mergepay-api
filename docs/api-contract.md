# Mergepay API contract reference

The canonical client contract lives in `mergepay-web/src/lib/types.ts`. This file
is the local reference for the parts of the contract that are defined by this
repository, so a change here can be mirrored there in one step.

Keep this file in sync whenever a response shape, status vocabulary, error code,
or query convention changes.

---

## Error envelope

Every error — validation, authorization, rate limiting, upstream — uses one shape:

```json
{
  "error": "NOT_FOUND",
  "message": "Settlement not found",
  "statusCode": 404,
  "details": { "…": "optional, structured" },
  "requestId": "01J…"
}
```

`error` is a stable machine-readable code from `ErrorCode` in
[../src/lib/errors.ts](../src/lib/errors.ts). Codes worth calling out:

| Code | Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 400 | Request failed Zod validation; `details` lists the offending fields |
| `INVALID_CURSOR` | 400 | Pagination cursor was not produced by this API |
| `INTENT_EXPIRED` | 400 | The unsigned transaction's signing window has closed — request a new one |
| `XDR_MISMATCH` | 400 | The signed envelope does not match the intent it was built for |
| `XDR_MALFORMED` | 400 | The envelope could not be parsed at all |
| `INVALID_IDEMPOTENCY_KEY` | 400 | `Idempotency-Key` is outside 1–255 characters of `A–Z a–z 0–9 - _ . :` |
| `MISSING_IDEMPOTENCY_KEY` | 400 | The route requires an `Idempotency-Key` header and none was sent |
| `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT` | 409 | The key was already used with a different payload |
| `IDEMPOTENCY_IN_PROGRESS` | 409 | The first request with this key is still running; retry shortly |
| `UNAUTHORIZED` | 401 | Missing or invalid session |
| `TOKEN_EXPIRED` | 401 | Session token has expired (or is inside the near-expiry margin) — re-authenticate via SEP-10; `details.hint` spells out the challenge → sign → verify exchange |
| `INVALID_TOKEN` | 401 | Session token is malformed, wrongly signed, or missing required claims — it cannot be refreshed, only re-obtained by authenticating again |
| `FORBIDDEN` | 403 | Authenticated, but not permitted on this resource |
| `NOT_FOUND` | 404 | The resource does not exist |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | 429 | Per-route budget exhausted; `details.retryAfterSeconds` when available |
| `UPSTREAM_ERROR` | 502 | Horizon or an anchor failed |

`404` versus `403` is deliberate and consistent: a resource that does not exist
is `404`; one that exists but is not the caller's is `403`. Clients need to
distinguish "gone" from "not yours" to render a useful state, and the difference
leaks only the existence of an opaque identifier — never any content.

---

## Pagination

Applies to `GET /groups`, `/groups/:id/expenses`, `/groups/:id/settlements`, `/groups/:id/ledger`,
`/groups/:id/treasury/history`, `/anchors/sessions`, and `/history`. Defined in
[../src/lib/pagination.ts](../src/lib/pagination.ts).

### Query parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `limit` | integer 1–100 | `50` | Out of range → `VALIDATION_ERROR` (never silently clamped) |
| `cursor` | opaque string | — | From a previous response's `meta.nextCursor`; malformed → `INVALID_CURSOR` |
| `order` | `"desc"` \| `"asc"` | `"desc"` | Applies to the `(createdAt, id)` ordering |

### Response metadata

```ts
interface PageMeta {
  nextCursor: string | null;  // null when there is no further page
  hasMore: boolean;
  limit: number;              // the effective page size
  order: "asc" | "desc";
}
```

Guarantees:

- **Deterministic ordering.** Rows are ordered by the pair `(createdAt, id)`, so
  records sharing a timestamp have a defined order and can never appear on two
  pages or be skipped between them.
- **Bounded reads.** Each query fetches `limit + 1` rows — the page plus one
  lookahead row to compute `hasMore` — so no endpoint loads a full result set.
- **Cursors carry no authority.** A cursor contains only ordering coordinates,
  never a group id, user id, or permission. Scope comes from each query's own
  filter plus its membership check, so a cursor from one resource replayed
  against another can only move a page boundary inside data the caller may
  already read.

`GET /history` paginates two resources independently: `cursor` walks the expense
stream, `settlementCursor` walks the settlement stream, with metadata in `meta`
and `settlementMeta` respectively.

---

## Idempotency

Defined in [../src/services/idempotency.ts](../src/services/idempotency.ts).
Mobile networks and wallet callbacks retry after timeouts, so every
state-changing settlement request can be replayed safely.

### The header

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Header | `Idempotency-Key` |
| Length | 1–255 characters |
| Charset | `A–Z`, `a–z`, `0–9`, `-`, `_`, `.`, `:` |
| Validation | Zod, before any database read — out of bounds is `INVALID_IDEMPOTENCY_KEY` (400) |

| Endpoint | Key |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /expenses/:id/settle` | optional, honoured when sent |
| `POST /groups/:id/settlements` | optional, honoured when sent |
| `POST /settlements/:id/confirm` | **required** — missing is `MISSING_IDEMPOTENCY_KEY` (400) |
| `POST /groups/:id/treasury/{deposit,withdraw}`, `POST /treasury-transactions/:id/confirm` | optional, honoured when sent |

Submission requires a key because it is the request that ends in money moving:
a retry that slipped through unguarded could mean a second on-chain payment.

### Semantics

A key is stored against `(authenticated user, operation scope, key)` together
with a hash of the request's intent (scope, resource id, body).

- **Replay** — same user, same key, equivalent payload → the **original**
  response is returned verbatim. No second settlement record is created and no
  second envelope is handed to the worker for Horizon submission.
- **Different payload** — same user and key, different body → `409
  IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`. The first request's result is untouched.
- **Different user** — a key is invisible outside the account that used it.
  Another user sending the same string starts a fresh request; it never replays
  and never conflicts.
- **Different endpoint** — the scope is part of the identity, so the same string
  on an unrelated route is a separate key.
- **Concurrency** — the reservation row is written before the guarded operation
  runs, and the unique constraint serializes racing retries. The loser gets
  `409 IDEMPOTENCY_IN_PROGRESS` rather than a second execution, so concurrent
  requests produce exactly one durable outcome.
- **Failure** — the guarded operation runs inside a database transaction, so a
  failure rolls back completely and the key is marked `failed`. The same key may
  then be retried and will run exactly once more. A settlement is never left
  looking complete without a confirmed transaction: the request path only
  records a signed envelope, and the status only advances past `submitted` once
  the worker has a Horizon result.
- **Retention** — keys replay for 24 hours, then are swept.

Signed XDR validation happens **before** the key's operation begins, so an
invalid envelope is never recorded as an idempotent success — every retry with a
bad envelope gets the same fresh `XDR_MISMATCH`.

---

## Transaction intents and expiration

Defined in [../src/lib/time-bounds.ts](../src/lib/time-bounds.ts).

Endpoints that return an unsigned XDR (`POST /expenses/:id/settle`,
`POST /groups/:id/settlements`, `POST /groups/:id/treasury/deposit`,
`POST /groups/:id/treasury/withdraw`) include:

```ts
{
  xdr: string;                 // unsigned envelope for the wallet to sign
  networkPassphrase: string;
  expiresAt: string;           // ISO 8601, server-controlled
  expiresInSeconds: number;
}
```

- The deadline is derived from the **server** clock and is also set as the
  transaction's `maxTime`, so the stored intent and the on-chain envelope
  describe the same moment.
- `validitySeconds` (optional, 30–300) requests a **shorter** window. A client
  can never extend one and never supplies an absolute timestamp; out-of-range
  values are a `VALIDATION_ERROR`.
- `POST /settlements/:id/confirm` and `POST /treasury-transactions/:id/confirm`
  reject a lapsed intent with `INTENT_EXPIRED`. Submission additionally validates
  the signed envelope's own time bounds against the stored intent — an unbounded
  envelope, or one valid longer than its intent, is an `XDR_MISMATCH`.
- Comparisons allow a bounded **30-second** clock-skew tolerance.
- No expired transaction is ever submitted to Horizon or an anchor. The worker
  marks such a settlement `expired` and releases its expense share.

`Settlement` and `TreasuryTransaction` payloads both carry
`expiresAt: string | null` (null on rows predating expiration tracking).

### Signed XDR validation

Defined in [../src/services/settlement-xdr.ts](../src/services/settlement-xdr.ts)
and [../src/services/stellar.ts](../src/services/stellar.ts).

`POST /settlements/:id/confirm` loads the settlement's **stored** intent — never
anything the client sent alongside the envelope — and validates the signed XDR
against it before the envelope is persisted and before anything reaches Horizon.
The worker repeats the same check at submission time.

Checked, in order:

| Property | Rejected when |
| --- | --- |
| Envelope | Unparseable, or a fee-bump wrapper (`XDR_MALFORMED` / `XDR_MISMATCH`) |
| Validity window | No expiry, valid longer than the intent, already lapsed, or not yet valid |
| Transaction source | Not the settlement's payer |
| Operation count | Anything other than exactly one operation |
| Fee | Below the network minimum or above the fee the API built (per operation) |
| Operation type | Not a payment |
| Operation source | Overridden to an account other than the payer |
| Destination | Not the settlement's recipient |
| Asset | Different code, or the same code with a different issuer |
| Amount | Differs at 7-decimal precision |
| Memo | Not the settlement's own short code |
| Signature | Missing, or not verifiable against the source account for the configured network passphrase |

A mismatch is a `400` with a stable code (`XDR_MISMATCH`, `XDR_MALFORMED`, or
`INTENT_EXPIRED`) and a message naming the field that diverged. The signed
envelope, its signatures, and any key material are never included in the
response or in logs. A rejected transaction is never submitted and never
advances the settlement's status — the settlement stays awaiting a signature and
the wallet can sign the correct envelope instead.

---

## `GET /settlements/:id/status`

The single source of truth for a settlement's state after creating or signing it.
Defined in [../src/services/settlement-status.ts](../src/services/settlement-status.ts).

**Authentication:** required. **Authorization:** any member of the settlement's
group, via the same `requireMembership` helper the mutating routes use.

### Path parameter

`:id` accepts either the settlement's cuid or its human-facing `shortCode` (the
value that appears in the payment memo). Both are unique. Anything outside
`[A-Za-z0-9_-]{4,64}` is a `VALIDATION_ERROR` before any database read.

### Query parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `refresh` | `"true"` \| `"false"` | `"true"` | Whether to consult Horizon for on-chain confirmation |

### Response

```ts
interface SettlementStatusResponse {
  settlement: Settlement;              // the standard serialized settlement
  status: SettlementStatus;
  terminal: boolean;                   // whether `status` can still change
  onChain: {
    checked: boolean;                  // a Horizon lookup ran and answered in time
    found: boolean;                    // Horizon has a record of the transaction
    successful: boolean | null;        // Horizon's own flag; null if not found
    transactionHash: string | null;
  };
  // Present only when `status` is "failed"; null otherwise, including while a
  // settlement is still being retried. `category` is the stable value to
  // branch on; `reason` is scrubbed — no upstream text, XDR, or stack.
  failure: {
    category: SettlementFailureCategory;
    reason: string;
  } | null;
  expiresAt: string | null;            // ISO 8601
  expiresInSeconds: number | null;     // negative once lapsed
  createdAt: string;                   // ISO 8601
  updatedAt: string;                   // ISO 8601
  checkedAt: string;                   // ISO 8601, when this answer was computed
}
```

### Status values

```ts
type SettlementStatus =
  | "awaiting_signature"
  | "submitted"
  | "confirmed"
  | "failed"
  | "expired";
```

| Status | Terminal | Meaning | Client action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `awaiting_signature` | no | Unsigned XDR issued; no signed envelope returned yet | Sign it before `expiresAt` |
| `submitted` | no | A signed envelope was accepted and is being submitted; not yet confirmed on-chain | Keep polling |
| `confirmed` | yes | The payment succeeded on-chain | Done |
| `failed` | yes | Submission was rejected, or the transaction failed on-chain | Branch on `failure.category` |
| `expired` | yes | The signing window closed before submission | Create a new settlement |

An unrecognised internal status maps to `awaiting_signature` — conservative, and
never reported as paid.

### Failure categories

```ts
type SettlementFailureCategory =
  | "validation"
  | "insufficient_funds"
  | "expired"
  | "upstream"
  | "ledger_rejected"
  | "internal";
```

| Category | Meaning | Client action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `validation` | The request or signed envelope was wrong (malformed XDR, intent mismatch, authorization) | Fix the request; retrying the same input fails identically |
| `insufficient_funds` | The payer cannot cover the amount, the network fee, or the account reserve, or lacks the trustline | Fund the account or add the trustline, then settle again |
| `expired` | The signing window closed before submission | Create a new settlement; do not retry this one |
| `upstream` | Horizon or the anchor was unreachable, timed out, or rate-limited | Retry later; nothing is wrong with the request |
| `ledger_rejected` | The network rejected the transaction, or it failed on-chain | Permanent for this envelope; create a new settlement |
| `internal` | An unclassified failure inside the API | Retry; contact support if it persists |

The set is closed and stable — a client may switch on it exhaustively. A
settlement that failed before this field existed reports `internal` rather than
omitting the category, so the shape is the same for every failed settlement.

The same categories are assigned by both the request path and the background
worker, from one classifier, so a given failure is reported identically no
matter which process observed it.

### Pending is not confirmed

A transaction hash Horizon does not yet know about is the ordinary state for the
first seconds after submission, because Horizon only sees a transaction once it
is in a closed ledger. That case is reported as `onChain.found: false` with
status `submitted`. Only an explicitly successful Horizon record advances the
status to `confirmed`, and only an explicitly unsuccessful one to `failed`.

The Horizon lookup runs only when it could change the answer (there is a hash and
the status is not already terminal), is bounded by a 2.5s timeout, and degrades
to `onChain.checked: false` rather than failing the request if Horizon is slow or
erroring.

### Never returned

Signed or unsigned XDRs, private keys, anchor or session tokens, provider
credentials, upstream error text, and stack traces. `failure.reason` is limited
to the short, already-scrubbed message the worker recorded — capped at 300
characters, with bearer tokens, labelled secrets, bare Stellar secret seeds, and
bare transaction envelopes removed before it is ever persisted.

---

## Request size limits

Every size limit is explicit and configurable, and each has its own error code
so a client can tell what to change. All are answered as `413` — the request was
well-formed, just too large — except a body that is not multipart at all, which
is `415`.

| Limit | Environment variable | Default | Code when exceeded |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JSON body (global) | `JSON_BODY_LIMIT_BYTES` | 1 MB | `REQUEST_TOO_LARGE` |
| JSON body (auth, settlement, treasury, anchor routes) | `AUTH_BODY_LIMIT_BYTES` | 256 KB | `REQUEST_TOO_LARGE` |
| Uploaded file size | `MULTIPART_FILE_SIZE_BYTES` | 5 MB | `FILE_TOO_LARGE` |
| Files per request | `MULTIPART_MAX_FILES` | 1 | `TOO_MANY_FILES` |
| Single form field size | `MULTIPART_FIELD_SIZE_BYTES` | 64 KB | `FIELD_TOO_LARGE` |
| Total multipart parts | `MULTIPART_MAX_FIELDS` | 20 | `TOO_MANY_PARTS` |

A malformed multipart body is `400 BAD_REQUEST` with a fixed message; the
parser's own text is never echoed, because it can quote the malformed input.

Limits are applied at the narrowest scope that works. The multipart limits reach
only `POST /uploads/receipt`, the sole multipart route — the SEP-24 anchor flow
is JSON end to end — so ordinary JSON routes keep their own body limit and are
unaffected.

### Uploads never leave partial state

`POST /uploads/receipt` streams the file to a staging directory outside the
served path and renames it into place only once it has been fully received and
accepted. Nothing is buffered whole in memory, every rejection path removes the
partial file, and no URL is returned for a file that is not complete. A client
that aborts mid-upload leaves nothing behind.

---

## Rate limiting

Every route is covered by a global budget; SEP-10 authentication, signed
submission, and anchor routes each get their own bucket. See the table in
[../README.md](../README.md#rate-limiting) and the policy definitions in
[../src/lib/rate-limit.ts](../src/lib/rate-limit.ts).

A 429 uses the standard error envelope with `error: "RATE_LIMITED"` and, where
available, `details.retryAfterSeconds`, alongside the usual `Retry-After` and
`X-RateLimit-*` headers. It reveals nothing about the caller's identity or
whether a wallet account is known to the API.

---

## Health endpoints

Operational probes for deployments and load balancers. They require no
authentication and are not subject to application business authorization — a
monitoring probe must work without a session. See also
[../HEALTH.md](../HEALTH.md) for the deployment-facing view.

| Endpoint | Type | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /health` · `GET /health/live` | Liveness | `200` with `{ "status": "ok", "timestamp": "…" }` while the process can accept requests. Contacts nothing external. |
| `GET /health/ready` | Readiness | `200` with `{ "status": "ok", "checks": {…} }` when every required dependency is available; `503` with `{ "status": "not_ready", "checks": {…} }` otherwise. |

### Readiness checks

`GET /health/ready` verifies the dependencies the API needs to submit and
inspect transactions, using only read-only requests — never a state-changing
call:

| Check | What it verifies | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stellar` | The configured Horizon endpoint answers a read-only fee-stats request, proving the Stellar network configuration is usable end to end | `getFeeStats()` in `src/services/network.ts` — the shared Horizon client built from `config.HORIZON_URL`, no duplicated configuration |
| `database` | Prisma can run `SELECT 1` | Read-only query on the shared Prisma client |
| `anchor` | The configured anchor's `stellar.toml` is reachable | Read-only request; reported `disabled` when no anchor is configured |

Each check has its own 1.5-second timeout and results are cached for five
seconds, so an unavailable upstream never hangs a probe or thrashes Horizon.
A `down` status on any required check makes the whole response `not_ready`
with HTTP `503`, which lets a load balancer drain the instance.

Responses contain only the status vocabulary (`up`/`down`/`disabled`,
`ok`/`not_ready`) and a timestamp — never connection strings, Horizon URLs,
credentials, tokens, or upstream error text.

**Invalid Stellar configuration fails fast, before the API can report ready.**
`STELLAR_NETWORK` and `HORIZON_URL` are validated together at process start in
`src/config.ts`: a testnet URL with a `public` network (or vice versa) exits the
process with a clear error instead of serving a readiness endpoint that could
only ever report a broken dependency.
